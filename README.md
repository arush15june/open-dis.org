# Open-DIS

## An open source implementation of the Distributed Interactive Simulation protocol

[DIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Interactive_Simulation) is one of the most widely used protocols in Department of Defense, NATO, and allied nations real time/virtual world modeling and simulation. Open-DIS is a free, open source implementation of the standard in Java, C++, and C#.  The project uses a BSD-style open source license, which is non-viral and business-friendly.

Open-DIS is developed mainly by the [MOVES Institute at the Naval Postgraduate School](https://www.movesinstitute.org). Participation by other individuals and groups is welcome and encouraged.

# Distributed Interactive Simulation

DIS is an IEEE standard (IEEE-1278.1) developed by the Simulation Interoperability Standards Group (SISO) and approved by IEEE. It is very widely used in real time, virtual world military simulations. 

DIS is a network protocol. It describes the exact layout of a few dozen Protocol Data Units (PDUs) that contain information about the position and orientation of entities in the world, and much else. The are PDUs that describe electronic warfare, logistics, collisions, and simulation management.
